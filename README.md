# Business Terms Spelling and Grammar Correction

## Project Overview
BizTerm Correct is a system designed for correcting spelling and grammar in business terminology using Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and phonetic matching. It processes business-related textual data, identifies errors, and provides corrections using advanced linguistic models.

## Packages Used
### NLP & Text Processing:
spacy – Tokenization, Named Entity Recognition (NER)
nltk – Stopword removal, POS tagging, lemmatization
transformers – Pre-trained language models for text analysis
textdistance, fuzzywuzzy, rapidfuzz – Edit distance and similarity matching
metaphone – Phonetic-based spelling correction

### Machine Learning & Feature Engineering:
sklearn.feature_extraction.text – TF-IDF Vectorization

### Spelling & Grammar Correction:
language_tool_python – Grammar checking and correction
textdistance.Levenshtein, fuzzywuzzy, rapidfuzz – Edit distance for spell-checking

### Dataset Handling & Business Document Extraction:
pandas – Data management and preprocessing
pdfplumber – Extracting text from business documents (PDFs)

### User Interface & Interaction:
gradio – Web-based GUI for easy text correction

### Approaches Used
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Stopword removal and lemmatization for better text preprocessing
TF-IDF vectorization to extract important business-related terms

2. Spelling & Grammar Correction
Levenshtein Distance & Edit Distance Algorithms (textdistance, fuzzywuzzy)
Phonetic Matching (Metaphone, RapidFuzz, FuzzyWuzzy)
Grammar checking using language_tool_python

3. Machine Learning for Business Term Classification
TF-IDF Vectorization for converting text into numerical features

4. PDF & Business Document Handling
Extracting text from PDFs using pdfplumber
Processing structured business documents to enhance accuracy

5. Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Usability
Gradio-based Web UI for quick spelling & grammar correction

## Future Improvements
Integrate Deep Learning models (Transformer-based spell-checkers)
Enhance business-specific terminology detection
