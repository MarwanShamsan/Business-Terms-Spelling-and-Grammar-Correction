# Business Terms Spelling and Grammar Correction

## Project Overview

BizTerm Correct is designed for spelling and grammar correction in business terminology, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and phonetic matching. The system processes textual data, detects errors, and provides corrections using advanced linguistic models.

## Packages Used

### NLP & Text Processing: 
spacy, nltk, transformers, textdistance, fuzzywuzzy, rapidfuzz, metaphone
sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer

### Spelling & Grammar Correction:
language_tool_python, textdistance.Levenshtein, fuzzywuzzy, rapidfuzz

Dataset Handling & Extraction: pandas, pdfplumber, PyPDF2

### User Interface: 
gradio

## Approaches Used

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Stopword removal and lemmatization

TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction

Spelling & Grammar Correction

Levenshtein Distance & Edit Distance Algorithms (textdistance, fuzzywuzzy)

Phonetic Matching (Metaphone, RapidFuzz, FuzzyWuzzy)

Grammar validation using language_tool_python

Machine Learning for Business Term Classification

Random Forest Classifier trained on business-related text

TF-IDF Vectorization for transforming text into numerical features

PDF & Business Document Handling

Extracting text from PDFs using PyPDF2 and pdfplumber

Processing structured business documents for enhanced accuracy

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Gradio-based Web UI for quick spelling & grammar correction


## Future Improvements

Integrating deep learning models for advanced spell-checking

Enhancing business-specific terminology detection

Expanding support for multiple languages in business writing
